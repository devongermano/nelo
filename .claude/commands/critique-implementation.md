## Decision Tree

Based on critique results:

- **Critical Issues Found** ‚Üí Create fix plan and implement immediately
- **Important Issues Only** ‚Üí Fix in current iteration
- **Minor Issues Only** ‚Üí Document for future improvement, approve current
- **No Issues** ‚Üí Mark as APPROVED and proceed to PR

Remember: The goal is continuous improvement, not perfection. Focus on critical and important issues that affect functionality, security, or maintainability.
